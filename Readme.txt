## Requirements

## Installation

- First of all, install the pod file to install all of the dependencies.
- Then open Rent-A-Bike.xcworkspace and build.

## Feedback

- There is a major mistake on the API documentation. According to the documentation, the register api call is a GET method.  But in real it's not. The register API is a POST methos. Please fix the mistake. This mistake took my 2-3 hours.
